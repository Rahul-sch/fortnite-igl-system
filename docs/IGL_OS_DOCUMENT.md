# IGL WINNING SYSTEM - OPERATING SYSTEM
## NAC Duos | Chapter 7 Season 1 | High Ping (35-45ms) | Builds

---

# 🎯 ONE-PAGE CHEAT SHEET

## GOLDEN RULES
1. **Position > Kills** — Every death is recoverable. Bad positioning is not.
2. **Leave Early** — If zone is far, leave 10-15 seconds BEFORE others.
3. **Deadside Priority** — Always rotate toward fewer teams, not toward "good position."
4. **Mats = Life** — Never enter endgame below 1500 total mats.
5. **Comm Once** — Say it once, trust your duo heard it.

## QUICK REFERENCE

| Situation | IGL Call | Script |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| Zone far, 2:30 on clock | Leave now | "Leaving in 5, full send [direction]" |
| Contested off spawn | Assess 3s | "Hold, checking count" → "One team" or "Multiple, disengage [exit]" |
| Surge 10+ behind | Tag priority | "Surge mode, looking tags only" |
| Teammate knocked mid | Box teammate | "I'm knocked, box me [ping]" |
| IGL knocked/dead | Teammate takes over | "You're IGL, I'm support" |
| Zone pulls opposite | Instant leave | "Pulling [direction], we go NOW" |

## MATS BENCHMARKS
- **Off spawn complete**: 300/200/200 minimum
- **Midgame rotate start**: 600/400/400
- **Endgame entry**: 1500+ total (any split)
- **Tarp-ready**: 800+ wood minimum

## TIMING BENCHMARKS
- **Storm 1**: Loot 2:00, leave by 2:30 remaining
- **Storm 2**: Leave with 1:30+ for far zones
- **Storm 3+**: Prioritize position over loot
- **Half-in/Half-out**: Always be INSIDE half when it starts closing

---

# SECTION A: IGL RULES (OPERATING SYSTEM)

## A.1 Role Division

### IGL Owns:
- **Macro decisions**: When to rotate, where to position, fight or refuse
- **Timing calls**: Leave timing, storm awareness, surge tracking
- **Zone reads**: Predicting pulls, planning paths
- **Econ management**: Mats allocation, heal usage approval
- **Engagement authority**: Final say on all fights (take/refuse/disengage)

### Fragger Owns:
- **Micro execution**: Aim, edit plays, piece control in fights
- **Enemy tracking**: Callouts during fights ("one cracked", "flesh on right")
- **First shot**: When IGL approves fight, fragger initiates
- **Refresh execution**: When IGL calls refresh, fragger executes the play

### Shared:
- **Information gathering**: Both constantly scanning, reporting intel
- **Box fighting**: Both participate, IGL can override if fight going bad
- **Resource calls**: Either can say "I need mats/heals"

## A.2 Tempo Control Framework

### SPEED Mode (Aggressive Rotation)
**When to use:**
- Zone pulls toward you
- Storm is closing and you're behind
- You have mobility items (wingsuit, launch pad, vehicle)
- Clear deadside path

**Execution:**
- Full sprint, minimal farming
- Skip secondary loot spots
- Accept fights ONLY if blocking path
- Comm: "Speed mode, no stops"

### SLOW Mode (Standard Rotation)
**When to use:**
- Comfortable zone position
- Need to farm mats
- Multiple teams visible but not engaging
- Default mode

**Execution:**
- Farm while moving
- Check angles every 50m
- Box up if shot at, then reassess
- Comm: "Slow mode, farming"

### FREEZE Mode (Hold Position)
**When to use:**
- Teams fighting nearby (third party opportunity OR third party threat)
- Unsure of team positions
- Waiting for zone info
- Surge comfortably ahead

**Execution:**
- Full stop, hold current cover
- Both players scan 360
- Do NOT shoot unless shot at
- Wait until situation resolves
- Comm: "Freeze, holding"

## A.3 "Positioning Wins Games" Framework

### Rule 1: ALWAYS Know Your Exit
Before settling any position, identify:
- Primary exit (preferred)
- Secondary exit (if primary blocked)
- Emergency exit (if both blocked - usually involves builds/mats)

### Rule 2: The 3-Team Rule
- If 3+ teams can see/shoot your position = BAD POSITION
- If 1-2 teams max can engage = GOOD POSITION
- If 0 teams can engage = IDEAL (but verify you're not cut off)

### Rule 3: Layer Logic (Endgame)
- **Layer 1** (edge of zone): Most vulnerable, most teams die here
- **Layer 2** (one build in): Survivable, need strong piece control
- **Layer 3** (two+ builds in): Premium position, protect it
- **Center**: Dangerous unless very late (too many angles)

### Rule 4: Highground vs Lowground
At 35-45 ping, **DO NOT** ego challenge highground retakes.
- If someone has height = find new angle or wait for them to drop
- Your ping makes piece control retakes 50/50 at best
- Claim uncontested height, don't fight for contested height

## A.4 Comms Protocol

### Priority Stack (What to call first)
1. **IMMEDIATE THREAT**: "ON ME!" / "PUSHED!"
2. **Enemy position**: "Team [direction] [distance]"
3. **Storm/Zone info**: "Zone pulling [direction]"
4. **Resource status**: "Low mats" / "No heals"
5. **Strategy change**: "Freeze" / "Speed mode" / "Fight"

### Anti-Clutter Rules
- **One callout, one response** — Don't repeat unless asked
- **No "I think"** — Either you see it or you don't
- **Direction + Distance only** — "Team north 100m" not "I see someone I think over by that building"
- **Damage numbers in fights only** — Don't clutter rotate comms
- **"Copy" or "Bet"** — Acknowledge IGL calls, then silence

### Reset Calls
When situation is chaotic, IGL can call "RESET":
- Both players box up separately
- 3 seconds of silence
- IGL gives new instruction
- Then continue

### IGL Dead Protocol
**INSTANT HANDOFF — No hesitation**

When IGL gets knocked:
1. IGL: "I'm down, you're IGL"
2. New IGL immediately takes over ALL macro decisions
3. Original IGL switches to support comms only (enemy tracking)
4. No discussion, no "what should I do" — new IGL decides

When IGL dies (cannot be rebooted):
1. Surviving player is now solo IGL
2. Switch to solo endgame protocol (Section D)
3. Original player can backseat if spectating, but final calls are survivor's

```

## B.2 Uncontested Drop

**This is the GOAL. Execute perfectly.**

### Script:
- IGL: "Clear, running route"
- Both: Execute memorized loot route
- IGL: "Looting [spot], you hit [spot]"
- Regroup at predetermined spot

### Checklist:
- [ ] Hit all primary chests (route memorized)
- [ ] Farm minimum mats (300/200/200)
- [ ] Both have weapon + shields
- [ ] Check zone at 2:30 remaining
- [ ] Regroup by 2:15

### Timing Targets:
| Time | Task |
|------|------|
| 0:00-0:45 | Initial loot + weapon |
| 0:45-1:30 | Full loot route |
| 1:30-2:00 | Mats + shields |
| 2:00-2:15 | Regroup |
| 2:15+ | Rotation decision |

## B.3 One-Team Contest

**Assess in 3 seconds, then commit to a plan.**

### Decision Framework:
```
Do we have better loot within 10 seconds of landing?
├── YES → Fight with advantage
│         Script: "We're up, pushing [location]"
│
└── NO → Check their loot
          ├── THEY'RE WEAK TOO → 50/50, IGL call
          │   Script: "Even fight, [fight/split]"
          │
          └── THEY'RE UP → Disengage
              Script: "They're up, splitting to [exit point]"
```

### If Fighting:
1. IGL: "Fighting, I'm [position]"
2. Fragger initiates
3. Quick trade - don't extend
4. If not winning in 20 seconds: "Resetting, box up"

### If Splitting:
1. Both disengage to predetermined exit
2. Loot backup area
3. Do NOT re-engage unless they chase with bad positioning
4. Accept less loot, survive

## B.4 Multi-Team Contest (3+)

**NEVER full commit. Your goal is SURVIVAL.**

### Immediate Protocol:
1. Land slightly offset (not center of POI)
2. Grab first gun + build
3. Assess in 3 seconds

### Script:
- IGL: "Multi-team, [count] teams"
- IGL: "Exit [direction], GO"
- Both: Full disengage, no fighting

### Exit Route Rules:
- Always have 2 exits pre-planned for every drop
- Exit toward FEWER teams, not toward zone
- Use terrain (hills, buildings) as cover
- Drop heals if you have to — surviving matters more

### If Forced to Fight:
- Fight the WEAKEST team only
- Quick kill → immediate disengage
- Never take a 1v2 situation team-wise
- Call: "One kill and out"

## B.5 Loot Weak Protocol

**Sometimes RNG gives you nothing. Here's how to survive:**

### "Loot Weak" Definition:
- No AR or SMG
- Less than 100 shield
- Less than 200 mats total
- Missing key heals

### Protocol:
1. IGL: "Loot weak, exit mode"
2. Do NOT fight anyone
3. Expand loot area — hit backup spots
4. Use terrain to avoid all teams
5. Accept that this game is about placement, not kills

### Script:
- "Loot weak, I have [current loadout]"
- "Expanding to [backup spot]"
- "Avoiding all fights until kitted"

## B.6 Teammate/IGL Knocked Off-Spawn

### Teammate Knocked:
1. IGL: "Box him" (if possible)
2. IGL takes fight or creates disengage
3. Revive only if safe (5+ second window)
4. If not safe: "Can't get you, try to crawl [direction]"

### IGL Knocked:
1. IGL: "I'm down [location], you're IGL"
2. New IGL decides: fight, box, or run
3. No backseat — new IGL has full authority
4. Original IGL only calls enemy positions

### Both Low (Crisis):
- Script: "Crisis mode"
- Both box separately
- Heal what you can
- Reassess: fight or run?

---

# SECTION C: MIDGAME ROTATIONS

**This is where games are won or lost. Master this section.**

## C.1 Leave Timing Rules

### The Golden Formula:
```
Leave Time = Storm Closes - (Distance/Movement Speed) - Buffer

Where:
- Distance = tiles to safe zone
- Movement Speed = ~12 tiles/minute sprinting
- Buffer = 20-30 seconds (for fights, farms, surprises)
```

### Quick Reference by Distance:

| Zone Distance | Leave With Time Remaining |
|--------------|---------------------------|
| 0-3 tiles | 1:00 (can wait longer) |
| 4-6 tiles | 1:30 |
| 7-10 tiles | 2:00 |
| 11-15 tiles | 2:30 |
| 16+ tiles | ASAP (edge spawn) |

### Storm Phase Specifics:

**Storm 1:**
- Large zone, plenty of time
- Leave with 2:30 for far pulls
- Can full loot even edge spawns

**Storm 2:**
- Storm moves faster
- Leave with 1:30-2:00
- Don't get greedy with loot

**Storm 3+:**
- Storm is fast and deadly
- Position > loot
- Half-in/half-out rule CRITICAL

## C.2 Deadside Creation

### What is Deadside?
- The direction with FEWEST teams
- Usually opposite the bus path
- Changes as game progresses

### How to Find Deadside:
1. Track team count during drop (bus path)
2. Listen for gunshots (teams fighting = teams located)
3. Storm direction (teams rotating FROM storm)
4. Kill feed (deaths = team locations)

### Script:
- "Deadside is [direction]"
- "Rotating [direction], expecting clear path"
- "Teams coming from [opposite direction]"

### Making Yourself Unpushable:
1. Rotate ON THE EDGE of zone, not through center
2. Keep natural cover between you and majority of teams
3. Never rotate through open ground if avoidable
4. If must cross open: SPEED MODE, wingsuit/vehicle if available

## C.3 Edge vs Early Center

### Edge Rotation (DEFAULT for high ping)
**When to use:** Most situations

**Pros:**
- Fewer angles to check
- Natural cover from zone edge
- Predictable team positions
- Easy to find deadside

**Cons:**
- Bad if zone pulls opposite
- Can get pinched
- Less flexibility

**Execution:**
- Follow zone edge
- One tile inside safe zone
- Farm while moving
- Check inward angles every 50m

### Early Center
**When to use:** ONLY if you're certain

**Requirements:**
- Zone confirmed pulling your direction
- Path is clear (scouted)
- You have mobility to escape if wrong
- Team count low in center area

**Pros:**
- Never bad zone pull
- Can gatekeep rotators
- Premium endgame position potential

**Cons:**
- Many angles to check
- Easy to get surrounded
- High risk if wrong

## C.4 Surge Planning

### Understanding Surge:
- Surge = damage threshold to avoid storm damage
- Check by pressing TAB — shows your team vs threshold
- Being under surge at close = TAKING STORM DAMAGE IN SAFE ZONE

### Surge Status Awareness:
- **10+ over:** Comfortable, can play passive
- **0-10 over:** Monitor, might need tags
- **Under:** SURGE MODE — must tag/fight

### Safe Tag Setups:
1. **Sniper hill:** Find natural highground, tag at range
2. **Edge peek:** Peek from edge cover toward rotators
3. **Box snipe:** Hard wall toward threat, soft wall to edit-peek
4. **Vehicle drive-by:** In vehicles, drive past and tag

### Script:
- "Surge check — we're [over/under] by [amount]"
- "Surge mode, looking tags"
- "Got tags, we're over now"
- "Still need [amount]"

### Fast Fight vs Refuse:

**Take Fight When:**
- Surge critical (10+ under)
- Isolated team (no third party risk)
- You have loot advantage
- Quick kill available (one cracked/low)

**Refuse Fight When:**
- Surge comfortable
- Multiple teams nearby
- Zone is closing
- Team is in strong position

### Emergency Surge Protocol:
When you're severely under and zone is closing:

1. IGL: "Emergency surge, we need [amount] NOW"
2. Both look for ANYTHING to tag
3. Accept risky shots (sniper through trees, ar spray)
4. If no tags available: "Taking storm damage, finding fight"
5. Push nearest team — being tagged is better than storm damage

## C.5 Zone Pulls Opposite Corner Playbook

**This is the worst case scenario. Here's how to survive:**

### Immediate Assessment (5 seconds):
1. How far? (Tiles to zone)
2. What mobility do we have?
3. What's between us and zone?

### The Protocol:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Zone pulls OPPOSITE CORNER             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
                   │
                   ▼

│  DO WE HAVE MOBILITY?                   │

                   │
    ┌──────────────┼──────────────┐
    ▼              ▼              ▼
 DEADSIDE       NATURAL        THROUGH
  EDGE          COVER           TEAMS
 (safest)      (balance)     (emergency)
```

### Refarm Plan:
While rotating opposite corner:
- **Wood:** Hit EVERY tree on path (don't stop, swing while running)
- **Brick:** Only if passing natural rock formations
- **Metal:** Skip unless vehicle/fence directly on path
- **Target:** 400+ wood priority (for tarps)

### Position Targets:
For opposite pulls, your goal is NOT center. It's:
1. **First safe position** inside zone
2. **Any natural cover** (hill, building, terrain)
3. **Layer 2** of builds if others already building

### What to Do If Keyed Mid-Rotate:
See Section C.6 (next)

## C.6 Getting Keyed Mid-Rotate (Contingency)

### Immediate Response:
1. "Keyed, boxing"
2. Both place boxes IMMEDIATELY (don't try to fight while moving)
3. Assess: one team or multiple?

### One Team Pushing:
```
Can we quick kill? (Are they in bad position?)
├── YES → "Turning, quick kill"
│         Execute, then IMMEDIATELY continue rotate
│         Do NOT loot bodies
│
└── NO → "Holding box, waiting"
          Make them commit mats
          Look for disengage opportunity
          Tunnel away when they reset
```

### Multiple Teams:
- "Multiple teams, tunneling [direction]"
- Do NOT fight — you cannot win 1v2v2
- Tunnel toward zone
- Use builds to break line of sight
- Accept taking damage if it gets you to zone

### The "Sacrifice Mats" Play:
If pinched and out of options:
1. Hard overbuild in one direction (make them think you're holding)
2. Immediately tunnel opposite direction
3. Let them waste ammo on empty builds
4. Get to zone, reset

---

# SECTION D: ENDGAME WIN CONDITIONS

## D.1 Layer Selection Logic

### Understanding Layers:
- **Layer 0 (Storm):** Dead players
- **Layer 1 (Edge):** Highest death rate, avoid
- **Layer 2 (One in):** Survivable, need awareness
- **Layer 3+ (Deep):** Premium, worth fighting for

### High Ping Layer Strategy (35-45ms):
At your ping, **DO NOT** fight for center/height against low ping players.

**Your ideal position:**
- Layer 2-3
- One side protected by storm or terrain
- Clear refresh angle
- NOT underneath contested height

### Layer Selection Protocol:
```
Zone closing →
1. Where are teams building?
2. Find the LEAST congested area
3. Claim layer 2 in that area
4. Protect your side, don't overextend
```

## D.2 Tarp Patterns (High Ping Safe)

### The "Wall + Ramp + Floor" Tarp:
At high ping, simple is better. Don't try fancy cone plays.

**Pattern:**
1. Wall facing threat
2. Ramp behind wall (gives you cover)
3. Floor above to protect from height
4. Repeat toward safe zone

**Rhythm:** Wall-Ramp-Floor, Wall-Ramp-Floor

### When to Tarp:
- Zone is closing
- You have clear path to next safe zone
- Threat is identified and you're blocking it
- NOT when surrounded (box first, then tarp)

### Tarp vs Box Decision:
- **Tarp:** One primary threat direction, zone moving
- **Box:** Multiple threat directions, zone stable
- **Both:** Box, wait for zone close, then tarp

### Material Priority:
1. **Wood first** — Fastest placement
2. **Brick second** — If you need to hold
3. **Metal last** — Only for crucial walls you need to tank

## D.3 Refresh Timing

### What is Refresh?
- Kill/knock to reduce lobby count
- Get enemy's mats/heals
- Reduce threat density

### When to Look for Refresh:
- Zone closing (teams forced to move)
- Team low next to you (obvious opportunity)
- You need mats/heals
- Lobby is cluttered (reduce threats)

### When to REFUSE Refresh:
- Multiple teams can third party
- Zone about to close (need to move)
- Target is bait (other team waiting)
- You're low and kill won't save you

### Script:
- "Refresh opportunity [direction]"
- "Going for refresh, cover"
- OR "Not worth, holding"

### High Ping Refresh Rules:
1. Don't chase kills into other teams' builds
2. Don't try piece control takes at high ping
3. Only go for refreshes where enemy is OUT of their box
4. Use AR spray + edit, not fancy plays

## D.4 Moving Zone Scripts

### Zone 5-6 (Semi-Finals):
- "Moving in [time], ready to tarp"
- "I'll tarp, you watch [direction]"
- "Tarping now" → Execute
- "Safe, next zone [direction]"

### Zone 7+ (Finals):
- Every word matters, keep it minimal
- "Move"
- "Stop" (if threat appears)
- "Refresh [direction]"
- "Zone [direction]"

### Duo Coordination:
- **IGL:** Calls movement, manages zone
- **Fragger:** Watches threats, calls contacts
- **Never both look same direction**

### The "Chain Tarp" Pattern:
When both need to move:
1. IGL: "You go, I cover"
2. Fragger tarps to safe spot
3. Fragger: "Safe, covering you"
4. IGL tarps to fragger's position or parallel
5. Repeat

## D.5 Teammate Dies: Solo Conversion

**The moment your duo dies, your game changes completely.**

### Immediate Checklist:
- [ ] How many mats do I have?
- [ ] What heals do I have?
- [ ] Where is zone going?
- [ ] What's my current layer?
- [ ] Can I get their loot?

### Solo Win Condition:
At high ping, solo wins come from:
1. **Survival** — Outlast, don't outfight
2. **Third party** — Let others fight, clean up
3. **Zone control** — Be in good position, make them come to you

### Solo Endgame Rules:
1. **Never 50/50** — You have no backup
2. **Box and observe** — Information is power
3. **One-shot opportunities only** — Sniper, AR beam on moving target
4. **Let them come** — Don't push into builds
5. **Final 3: Wait** — Let final 2 fight, third party winner

### Script (to yourself):
- "Solo now, survival mode"
- "Zone [direction], I have [mats]"
- "Waiting for opportunity"
- "That's my shot" → Only take clear opportunities

## D.6 IGL Dies: Teammate Endgame Protocol

### If you're the surviving fragger and IGL died:

**Your new responsibilities:**
- All macro decisions are yours
- Zone tracking
- Fight/refuse decisions
- No one is going to tell you what to do

### Mindset Shift:
- You've been executing all game
- You KNOW what good positioning looks like
- Trust your mechanics
- Play YOUR game, not what you think IGL would do

### Key Reminders:
- Check zone every 10 seconds
- Don't overpeak — you're solo
- Preserve mats for endgame
- One kill at a time

**Best for:** Fraggers who want fights, central positioning
**Chests:** 28 | **Shields:** Moderate | **Mats:** High metal

**Loot Route:**
1. Land main street theater building
2. Hit all chests in theater
3. Cross to sewer entrance
4. Clear sewer chests
5. Emerge near highway
6. Clear remaining street buildings

**Contest Plan:**
- Split theater/highway buildings with duo

- Abundant fight opportunities (high traffic)

**Storm Pulls:**
| Pull Direction | Response |
|---------------|----------|
| To us (center) | Stay and control, fight for position |
| Away (edge) | Early leave, use vehicle on highway |
| Opposite corner | IMMEDIATE leave, grab vehicle, go |

**Benchmarks:**
- 0:45 — First building clear, gun + mats
- 1:30 — Full route done, regroup
- 2:00 — Full load, zone check, ready to move

### #2 Sandy Strip (Score: 6.91)
**Best for:** Balanced loot + action
**Chests:** 22 | **Shields:** High (slurp truck) | **Mats:** High metal

**Loot Route:**
1. Land at casino main building
2. Clear all 3 floors
3. Move to The Sphere
4. Clear surrounding buildings
5. Check slurp truck at north end
6. Regroup at main street

**Contest Plan:**

# APPENDIX B: High Ping Specific Rules

At 35-45ms ping, you are at a disadvantage in piece control.
Here's how to compensate:

1. **Never 50/50 piece control** — Assume you lose
2. **Prefire everything** — Your shots need to leave early
3. **Use builds defensively** — Not offensively
4. **AR/Sniper meta** — Long range neutralizes ping
5. **Let them edit first** — React, don't initiate pieces
6. **Trade, don't piece** — Both hit each other > piece battle
7. **Use terrain** — Natural cover doesn't require builds
