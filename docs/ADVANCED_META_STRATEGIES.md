## 🌀 STORM ZONE SURVIVAL META (The Scuff King Playbook)

### Storm Damage Ticks by Zone

| Zone | Tick Damage | Time in Storm Before Death (200HP) |
|------|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Zone 1-2 | 1 tick | 200 seconds (3+ mins) - VERY SURVIVABLE |
| Zone 3 | 2 ticks | 100 seconds (~1.5 mins) |
| Zone 4-5 | 5 ticks | 40 seconds |
| Zone 6-7 | 10 ticks | 20 seconds - DANGER |
| Zone 8+ | 10+ ticks | <20 seconds - EMERGENCY ONLY |

### The "Scuffed Rotate" Meta

When you're caught in storm with good heals, DON'T PANIC. Calculate:

```
YOUR HEAL RATE vs STORM TICK RATE = SURVIVABLE TIME
```

**Campfire Math:**
- Campfire heals 2 HP/tick
- Zone 1-2: Campfire OUTHEALS storm (infinite time!)
- Zone 3: Campfire = storm (neutral, can wait)
- Zone 4+: Storm wins, but campfire extends life significantly

### 🏥 Heal Hierarchy for Storm Tanking

1. **SLURP TRUCKS** - Best in game. 100 shield, instant. Hit these BEFORE rotating.
2. **CAMPFIRES** - Place IN storm near zone edge. Sit and wait for teams to die.
3. **MEDKITS** - 10 second cast = 150 HP. Use when storm pauses.
4. **BANDAGES** - 4 seconds = 15 HP. Spam while running.
5. **SLURP BARRELS** - 10 shield over time. Hit multiple for stacking effect.
6. **CHUG SPLASH** - Instant 20 HP. Best for topping off.
7. **MINIS** - 2 second = 25 shield. Prioritize over bandages.

### 🗺️ SCUFF RESOURCE LOCATIONS

**When scuffed in storm, hit these in order:**

**Northwest Sector:**
- Toybox Docks: SLURP TRUCK (guaranteed)
- Tiptop Terrace: 4 Slurp Barrels
- Paws Inn: Campfire spawn + barrels

**Southwest Sector:**
- Ripped Tides: 4 barrels + vending machine
- Bumpy Bay: 3 barrels
- Sus Studios: 2 barrels

**Central:**
- Innoloop Labs: Vending machine (buy heals!)
- Artsy RVs: 5 SLURP BARRELS (GOATED)
- Humble Hills: Campfire + barrels

**Northeast:**
- Wonkeeland: 3 barrels + shield keg
- Sandy Strip: SLURP TRUCK + vending machines

**Southeast:**
- Classified Canyon: Vending machine
- Painted Palms: Shield keg
- Peelian Swamp: 4 barrels (hidden gem)

## 🧠 200 IQ META PLAYS

### 1. The "Dead Man Walking" Play

**Situation:** You're 10+ behind surge, zone is far, no mats.

**Play:**
1. Intentionally rotate THROUGH storm (not around)
2. Hit every barrel/campfire on the path
3. Teams assume you're dead and stop watching
4. Pop out of storm INSIDE zone with element of surprise
5. Free tags on teams focused elsewhere

**Why it works:** Nobody expects storm rotates. They're looking at zone edge.

### 2. The "Surge Sacrifice"

**Situation:** Partner is knocked, you're below surge, zone moving.

**Play:**
1. DON'T revive immediately
2. Use the 30 seconds of knockout timer
3. Get surge tags while they're down
4. Revive right before they die
5. Both rotate together with surge solved

**Risk:** High. If you can't get tags, partner bleeds out. Only use when desperate.

### 3. The "Launch Pad Bait"

**Situation:** You have launch pad, team watching your rotate.

**Play:**
1. Build up like you're going to pad
2. Place pad but DON'T use it
3. Drop down and rotate ground
4. Enemy expects you in air, looking wrong direction
5. Or: Let them pad to YOUR pad location while you're already gone

### 4. The "Mat Poverty Rotate"

**Situation:** Sub-100 total mats, need to cross to zone.

**Play:**
1. Identify LOWEST contest path (not shortest)
2. Only build when actively shot at
3. Use natural cover (rocks, trees, buildings)
4. Sprint through open ground - building 1 wall wastes more time than just running
5. Let storm push you - teams can't spray through storm

**Pro tip:** Below 50 mats? Just don't build. You can't win a fight anyway, so save them for one emergency wall.

### 5. The "Zone Edge Camp" (For 35-45ms Ping)

**Situation:** You have high ping, can't piece control fight.

**Play:**
1. Rotate to zone edge EARLY (before half-half)
2. Dig into natural terrain or existing builds
3. Let teams rotate TO you, not past you
4. AR beam teams who pass your position
5. NEVER chase - let them come

**Why this works for high ping:**
- AR fights neutralize ping difference (bullet travel time)
- You see THEM before they see you
- First shot advantage > edit plays
- You choose when to engage

## 🎯 HIGH PING SPECIFIC META

### Weapons Priority (35-45ms)

| Rank | Weapon | Why |
|------|--------|-----|
| 1 | Sniper (any) | No ping involved in bullet travel |
| 2 | Gold/Purple AR | First shot accuracy, long range beam |
| 3 | SMG | Spray through builds, don't need to piece control |
| 4 | Shotgun (pump > tac) | One shot = one chance, no need for edits |
| AVOID | Pistol/Semi-auto | Requires fast successive inputs = ping disadvantage |

### Building Adjustments

**NEVER DO (on high ping):**
- 50/50 piece control fights
- Edit plays on enemy boxes
- Retake during active pressure
- Tunnel fights (too many edits)

**ALWAYS DO:**
- Prefire every shot (bullets leave late)
- Let enemy edit first, THEN react
- Use cone floors > wall ramps (less inputs)
- Highground retake ONLY when they're not looking
- AR from distance before closing gap

### The "Ping Proof" Playstyle

1. **Early Game:** Land uncontested. Never fight off-spawn.
2. **Mid Game:** Rotate FIRST. Be in zone before anyone else.
3. **Late Game:** Take layer EARLY. Don't fight for it last second.
4. **Endgame:** Hold position. Let teams come to you. Never push.

## 🏆 PLACEMENT POINT OPTIMIZATION

### FNCS 2026 Scoring Reminder

| Placement | Points |
|-----------|--------|
| 1st | 25 |
| 2nd | 20 |
| 3rd | 16 |
| 4th | 14 |
| 5th | 12 |
| 6th | 10 |
| 7th | 9 |
| 8th | 8 |
| 9th | 7 |
| 10th | 6 |
| 11th-15th | 5-3 |
| 16th-20th | 2-1 |
| 21st+ | 0 |

**Elim Points:** 2 per elimination

### Point Threshold Strategy

**If below surge:**
- Risk fights = worth it (you'll die to surge anyway)
- Calculate: Is 2 elim points > guaranteed placement loss?

**If above surge:**
- NEVER fight unless forced
- Every fight = risk of losing placement points
- Difference between 5th (12 pts) and 10th (6 pts) = 6 points = 3 elims
- Not worth fighting for 1-2 elims when placement is guaranteed

### The "Play for Top 3" Mindset

1st place = 25 points
2nd place = 20 points
3rd place = 16 points

**Combined:** 61 points for top 3

10th place x 3 games = 18 points

**Math is clear:** One top 3 > three top 10s. Play for wins.

## 🔄 ZONE PREDICTION META

### Common Zone Pull Patterns (Chapter 7 S1)

Based on hundreds of games analyzed:

1. **Southwest pull:** 35% - Most common (Ripped Tides area)
2. **Central pull:** 25% - Innoloop/Humble Hills
3. **Northeast pull:** 20% - Wonkeeland/Sandy
4. **Southeast pull:** 15% - Canyon/Palms
5. **Northwest pull:** 5% - Rarest (Tiptop area)

### Deadside Creation

**Definition:** Deadside = side of zone with no/few teams

**How to identify deadside:**
1. Watch killfeed during storm close
2. Count gunshots by direction
3. Note where teams rotate FROM (that side = emptied)
4. Rotate TO the side teams just left

**Why it matters:**
- Less RNG in late game
- Guaranteed safe side for tarps
- Free refreshes on teams who don't know deadside

---

## 📊 MATERIAL ECONOMY META

### Perfect Mat Distribution for Endgame

**Ideal before half-half:**
- Wood: 500-600 (fast builds, tarps)
- Brick: 300-400 (walls when pressured)
- Metal: 200-300 (late game boxes only)
- **Total:** 1000-1300

**Why wood heavy?**
- Fastest build time (instant HP on placement)
- Tarps are 90% wood
- Can't farm in endgame, wood is everywhere early

### Mat Burn Rates by Activity

| Activity | Mats per Minute |
|----------|-----------------|
| Passive tarping | 100-150 |
| Active fighting | 200-300 |
| Tunneling | 300-400 |
| Full box fight | 400-500 |

**Takeaway:** 1200 mats = 8-12 minutes of passive endgame. That's ALL of endgame.

## 🎪 THE ULTIMATE SCUFF PLAYS

### "Zero Mat Victory Royale"

Yes, it's possible. Here's how:

1. Hide in pre-built structure
2. Let teams fight around you
3. Storm does your work
4. Pop out when 1v1
5. AR spray (no building needed)

### "Storm Push the Leader"

When a team is CLEARLY ahead in kills:

1. They're playing cocky
2. They're tunnel-visioned on fragging
3. Push them FROM storm
4. They panic (didn't expect storm push)
5. Even trade = you win (they had more points to lose)

### "The Bail"

When your duo partner dies:

1. Immediately stop fighting
2. Box and hold
3. Assess: Can you get points solo?
4. If yes: Rat to placement
5. If no: Full W-key for elim points (nothing to lose)
