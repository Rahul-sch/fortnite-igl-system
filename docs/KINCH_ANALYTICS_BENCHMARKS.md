## 🎯 KEY INSIGHTS FROM KINCH DATA

### 1. Damage Ratio is KING

The best players have damage ratios of **2.0+**, meaning they deal DOUBLE what they take.

**How to improve:**
- Only take fights you can win
- Disengage when hurt
- AR beam before pushing
- Use natural cover

### 2. Material Economy Matters

Top players farm **3000+ mats per game**. kbmrapid averaged over **27,000 mats** in a Finals session.

**How to improve:**
- Hit every tree/rock while rotating
- Don't waste mats on unnecessary builds
- Know refarm spots on the map

### 3. DPM Correlates with Placement

Players with **60+ DPM** consistently place higher because they're:
- Applying pressure
- Getting surge tags
- Not hiding all game

### 4. Builds = Survival

Top fraggers like sphinxfn place **6000+ builds** per session. More builds = better protection = higher placement.
